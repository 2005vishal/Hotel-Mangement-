# Hotel Management System

# Introduction:

The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate various operations within a hotel establishment. It aims to enhance the efficiency of hotel management by providing tools for managing room bookings, handling guest information, processing payments, managing restaurant services, and maintaining booking histories. This system offers a user-friendly interface for both hotel staff and guests, facilitating smooth interactions and improving overall customer experience.

# Key Features:

- Room Booking: The system allows guests to book rooms of different types (Standard Non-AC, Standard AC, 3-Bed Non-AC, and 3-Bed AC) for specified check-in and check-out dates. It collects essential guest information such as name, age, mobile number, and ID for booking purposes.

- Payment Processing: Guests can make payments for their bookings using various modes such as Credit Card, Debit Card, Net Banking, or Cash. The system generates transaction IDs for payment verification and maintains a record of payment details.

- Cancellation Management: Guests have the option to cancel their bookings if necessary. Upon cancellation, the system updates room availability, marks the booking status as "Cancelled," and processes refunds if applicable.

- Restaurant Services: The system offers restaurant services where guests can place food orders using their booking IDs. It provides a menu with various food items and calculates the total amount for the order. Guests can make payments for restaurant services similar to room bookings.

- Room Availability Check: Guests can check the availability of rooms for their desired dates and room types. The system provides real-time updates on room availability, allowing guests to make informed decisions when booking.

- Booking History: Guests can view their booking history by providing their booking IDs. The system displays details of past bookings, including room type, check-in/out dates, payment status, and transaction IDs.

- Room Information: The system offers information about different types of rooms available in the hotel. It provides descriptions of room amenities, helping guests make informed choices when booking accommodations.
